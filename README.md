# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

##Overview of the analysis
This project was done to see how many employees are retiring filtering by department and how many employees are qualified for the mentorship programs at Pewitt Hackard.

##Results
Creating a table of people eligible to retire shows 133776 employees. But this is an all time list and has possible duplicates from title swapping.
A unique titles table was created to filter out the duplicates who have changed titles while with the company. This lowered the number of retiring employees to 72457.
The final filter was done by titles so the number of retiring employees was better broken down

The above data was then used to count the number of employees that qualify for the mentorship program.
The final count for retiring employees is 72458 and the count that is eligible for the mentorship program is 1549

##Summary
Below is an image of the breakdown of retiring employees as well as the number of employees from each title that is eligible for the mentorship program.

There are a total of 72458 employees retiring and 1549 in the mentor program. Just over 17 percent are in the program across all titles. With Senior Staff, Senior Engineer, and Manager having less than 2 percent, I would be worried those departments are not equipped to mentor the next wave of employees. Especially manager as it has none, but this also means that not that many managers are leaving the company through retirement.
